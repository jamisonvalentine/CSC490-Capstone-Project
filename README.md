# Senior Capstone Project
This repo was created for the CSC490 Senior Capstone Project at The University of North Carolina Greensboro

## Project Idea:
A tool that gives UNCG students the ability to view transferable classes that they can take at an NC Community College in order to save money or take a class that is not available at UNCG.

- [UNC Online](https://www.gtcc.edu/_files/registration/gtcc_fall_2020_course_schedule.pdf) for online classes at another university

## Future Considerations:
- Create a common application to be used at any of the community colleges (apply as visiting student)
- Provide ability for users to check available seats in-app
- Provide ability for users to import DegreeWorks info
